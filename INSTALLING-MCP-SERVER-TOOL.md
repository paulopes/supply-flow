# supply-flow — MCP App Installation Guide

An MCP server that exposes supply-flow as a tool with an interactive UI. When called from any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and others), the generated supply flow diagram renders **inline in the conversation** — clickable nodes, CFR tooltips, acronym expansions, and all.

## What It Does

You ask Claude to create a supply flow diagram, and it calls the `generate-supply-flow-diagram` tool on your local MCP server. The tool returns a self-contained HTML diagram, and the MCP App view renders it directly in the chat — no need to open a separate file.

## Quick Install (Automated)

Clone the repo, install dependencies, build, then run the installer:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:paulopes/supply-flow.git && cd supply-flow
npm install
npm run build
npm run install-mcp
```

This defaults to writing `.mcp.json` in the current local directory, typically a project's root directory, which works with Gemini CLI and with other local MCP clients such as Claude Code on a per project basis.

To install globally for Claude Code in the terminal or inside Claude Desktop:

```bash
npm run install-mcp:claude-code
npm run install-mcp:claude-desktop
```

To install for a specific IDE:

```bash
npm run install-mcp:vscode
npm run install-mcp:cursor
npm run install-mcp:windsurf
npm run install-mcp:antigravity
npm run install-mcp:antigravity-global
```

To install for Gemini CLI (project-level or global):

```bash
npm run install-mcp:gemini-cli
npm run install-mcp:gemini-cli-global
```

The Gemini CLI installers also add `supply-flow` to the `mcp.allowed` list in the corresponding `settings.json`.

Run `npm run install-mcp -- --list` or `install-supply-flow-mcp --list` to see all supported clients and their config file locations.

The installer verifies that `npm install` and `npm run build` have already been run, and registers the MCP server in the target client's config.

## Manual Setup

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone git@github.com:paulopes/supply-flow.git && cd supply-flow
npm install
npm run build
```

The build step bundles the MCP App view into `dist/mcp-app.html`.

### 2. Register the MCP server

Add the server entry to your client's MCP configuration file:

| Client | Config file | Servers key |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Claude Code (global)| `~/.claude/.mcp.json` (macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.mcp.json` (Windows) | `mcpServers` |
| Claude Desktop | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows) | `mcpServers` |
| Claude Code (local) | `.mcp.json` (project root) | `mcpServers` |
| VS Code (Github Copilot) | `.vscode/mcp.json` (project root) | `servers` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json` (Windows)  | `mcpServers` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` (macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.codeium\windsurf\mcp_config.json` (Windows)  | `mcpServers` |
| Antigravity (project) | `.vscode/settings.json` (project root) | `gemini.codeAssist.mcpServers` |
| Antigravity (global) | `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json` (macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\antigravity\mcp_config.json` (Windows) | `mcpServers` |
| Gemini CLI (project) | `.gemini/settings.json` (project root) | `mcpServers` |
| Gemini CLI (global) | `~/.gemini/settings.json` (macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\settings.json` (Windows) | `mcpServers` |

**Example (Gemini CLI / Claude Code / Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf / Antigravity global):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supply-flow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/supply-flow/main.mjs", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example (Antigravity project — `.vscode/settings.json`):**
```json
{
  "gemini.codeAssist.mcpServers": {
    "supply-flow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/supply-flow/main.mjs", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example (VS Code):**
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "supply-flow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/supply-flow/main.mjs", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/supply-flow` with the actual path where you cloned the repo.

**Windows example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supply-flow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\you\\supply-flow\\main.mjs", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Other clients (e.g. Goose)

Any MCP-compatible client can use supply-flow — you just need to add the server entry in that client's configuration format. For example, **Goose** uses YAML (`~/.config/goose/config.yaml`):

```yaml
extensions:
  supply-flow:
    command: node
    args:
      - /absolute/path/to/supply-flow/main.mjs
      - --stdio
```

The key information is always the same — `node` as the command, and the absolute path to `main.mjs` with `--stdio` as arguments. Consult your client's documentation for the exact config file location and format.

### 3. Enable the server (Claude Code only)

Claude Code requires the server to be listed in `enabledMcpjsonServers` in `~/.claude/settings.json`. The generated diagrams can also exceed the default 25 000-token MCP output limit, so you should raise `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS`:

```json
{
  "enabledMcpjsonServers": ["supply-flow"],
  "env": {
    "MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS": "75000"
  }
}
```

If `enabledMcpjsonServers` already exists, add `"supply-flow"` to the array. The automated installer (`npm run install-mcp`) does both of these automatically.

### 4. Restart the client

After registering the server, **fully quit** your client and relaunch it. For Claude Code, closing the window is not enough — you must quit the application entirely (e.g. `Ctrl+Q` or right-click the system tray icon → Quit).

### 5. Verify

In a Claude Code session, ask:

> "What tools do you have?"

You should see `generate-supply-flow-diagram` in the list. If you also have the supply-flow skill installed, Claude will know when and how to use it automatically.

## Usage

Ask Claude to create a supply flow diagram. For example:

> "Create a lifecycle diagram for the E-Rate program under 47 CFR Part 54 Subpart F."

Claude will:

1. Research the relevant CFR sections
2. Build the JSON config following the supply-flow schema
3. Call the `generate-supply-flow-diagram` MCP tool with the config
4. The diagram renders inline — click any node to see the CFR text

You can also provide a config object directly:

> "Generate a diagram from this config: { ... }"

## How It Works

The MCP server registers two things:

| Component | URI / Name | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Tool** | `generate-supply-flow-diagram` | Accepts a supply-flow JSON config, returns self-contained HTML |
| **UI Resource** | `ui://supply-flow/mcp-app.html` | Bundled MCP App view that renders the HTML in an iframe |

When an MCP Apps-capable host (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, VS Code) calls the tool, it also reads the `_meta.ui.resourceUri` to fetch the view. The view receives the tool result and renders the diagram inline in the conversation, inside a sandboxed iframe.

Hosts that don't support MCP Apps still get the full HTML as text content — Claude can save it as a file or provide it as a download.

## Combining with the Skill

For the best experience, install **both** the MCP server and the supply-flow skill:

- The **skill** (`supply-flow-SKILL.md`) teaches Claude the full JSON schema, layout selection heuristics, quality checklist, and color conventions
- The **MCP server** gives Claude the ability to generate and render diagrams directly

With both installed, Claude knows *what* to build (from the skill) and *how* to render it (via the tool).

To install the skill in Claude Code:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/supply-flow
cp skill/supply-flow-SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/supply-flow/SKILL.md
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
mkdir -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\supply-flow"
copy skill\supply-flow-SKILL.md "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\supply-flow\SKILL.md"
```

## Development

To work on the MCP App view with live reload:

```bash
npm start
```

This runs both `vite build --watch` (rebuilds the view on changes) and the MCP server with `--watch` (restarts on server code changes).

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- An MCP-compatible client (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, VS Code, ChatGPT, etc.)
- `npm install` and `npm run build` must be run before first use

## Known Limitations

### VS Code MCP tool output size

VS Code imposes a hard byte limit on MCP tool output that **cannot be configured** by the user. Complex diagrams with many CFR sections and lengthy quoted text may be truncated. The library API automatically minifies the HTML output to reduce byte count, but very large diagrams may still exceed the limit. If you encounter truncation in VS Code, consider reducing the number of `defined` entries or shortening the quoted text.

Claude Code has a similar limit (`MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS`, default 25 000 tokens) but it **can** be increased — the automated installer sets it to 75 000 in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
